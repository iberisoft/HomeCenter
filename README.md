# HomeCenter

![.NET Core](https://github.com/iberisoft/HomeCenter/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

Home automation project started to be used at my house.

The project is designed to be neutral to hardware, i.e. a new device can add to the system by just developing a corresponding type
with properties/events.

Read more information how to install and configure the project on [Wiki](../../wiki).
