Home automation project started to be used at my house.

The project is designed to be neutral to hardware, i.e. a new device can add to the system by just developing a corresponding type
with properties/events.

Read more information how to install and configure the project on [Wiki](https://github.com/iberisoft/HomeCenter/wiki).
